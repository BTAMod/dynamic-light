# BTA Dynamic Light Mod

this mod make few item such as Torch, Lava Bucket lighting everything around them when you holding them or drop them on the groud. this doesn't increase light level

this mod is a port of beta 1.7.3 version of atomicStryker's dynamic light since BTA is a heavily modified beta 1.7.3 anyway
