# BTA Dynamic Light Mod

this mod make few item such as Torch and Lava Bucket lighten around you when you holding it or drop it on the groud. this mod is fully clientside that mean doesn't increase light level

this mod is a port of beta 1.7.3 version of atomicStryker's dynamic light since BTA is a heavily modified beta 1.7.3 anyway
